//Q85. Explain synthetic event in React js?
//Inside React event handlers, the event object is wrapped in a SyntheticEvent object. These objects are pooled, which means that the objects received at an event 
//handler will be reused for other events to increase performance.
//VAÅ½NO: This also means that accessing the event object's properties asynchronously will be impossible 
//since the event's properties have been reset due to reuse.

        //  console.log(event.target.value)

         setTimeout(()=>{
            // console.log(event.target.value)
            console.log(vrijednost)
         },3000)
